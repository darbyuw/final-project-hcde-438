## Project overview and purpose
This web application is an Interactive Choose-Your-Own-Adventure game. It follows the journey of a cat as it searches for fish in its neighborhood. The user plays the game from the perspective of the cat. This game aims to provide joy and entertainment to people of any age. Users are able to select between multiple options at each page of the game, leading them through different questions and scenarios. The game ends when the user has found five fish, or the cat has gotten distracted in some way. There are multiple different endings depending on the path that the user chooses.
## Technologies used

## Setup and installation instructions
To setup this web app, visit API Ninja's quote API: https://api-ninjas.com/api/quotes. From this site, create an account in the upper right corner. On your account page, copy and paste the API key connected to your account. Create a secrets.jsx file in the src folder. Ensure that secrets.jsx is hidden in .gitignore if commiting to a repository. Create and export a variable in secrets.jsx called apiKey. This will be used in the Quote component. 
To setup firebase (used to store game progress), visit https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/ sign in, create a new project, connect a web app in settings, and copy the corresponding apiKey code into the firebase.js file in src --> services.
